# MNIST classification from scratch on C++ and CUDA

I wrote a feed-forward neural network for the MNIST image classification dataset from scratch on C++ and CUDA in 2019.

I split the train.csv dataset into 30 000 train and 12 000 test images. Max accuracy that I got on these 12 000 test images was 98.233%.
